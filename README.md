POiNG
=====

POiNG is a modified version of the traditional game "Pong". Implemented using the Processing Environment. It is Java-based and runs on
desktop.

The concept of the game is to block the ball with the paddle. Throughout the game, items are displayed on the UI which helps the 
respective player if grabbed.

This was developed as a project for my Game Design course.
